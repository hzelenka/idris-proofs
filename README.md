# Idris Mathematical Proofs

A collection of Idris files proving important concepts in mathematics or whatever I feel like.

Currently working in Categories folder. Short term to-do list:

- Get the definitions in Categories/Products.idr to "work"
- Categorical definitions of groupoids, monoids, groups
- Opposite categories
